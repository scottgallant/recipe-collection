# Hello.

## This is a grand experiment.

Somehow, there's no out-of-the-box solution out there on the internet that works the way I want it to (said every [designer](http://www.sharonbrener.com) ever), so I'm biting the bullet and making it myself. In the process, I'm slowly teaching myself Jekyll, Git, and deep-diving into CSS/HTML for the first time since college. Seems like the world's a little different out there.

## This site is simply my personal recipe collection, styled the way I want it.

Recipes range from our family recipes or simple basics, to bigger DIY projects like making your own bitters or kombucha. Most of these are direct translations from other sources (thank you, sources!) and I lay no claims to the content.

Eventually, I hope to add fancy search and commenting functionality so that I can document what I've learned every time I make or remake a recipe. This is also an exercise in teaching myself to be patient. Is it working yet?

## A canonical recipe format should exist.

Because I work with [a bunch of wonderful nerds](https://data.world), I couldn't help but obsess over the recipe schema. My recipe template is based off of the entities on <https://schema.org/Recipe> and I've done my best to create a complete *(lolol)* set of tags that span meal type, ingredients, diets, cooking methods, cuisines, and seasons. It's complicated, and a perpetual work in progress.

## So, if you've somehow found yourself, [say hi](http://sharonbrener.com/contact/). I hope it makes you hungry.
