yield: Serves 2 as a main course, 4 as an appetizer. Doubles easily.
authorNote: Surprise… mussels are so easy. 6 ingredients and about 5 minutes later
  we had perfectly steamed mussels in a fancy aromatic sake broth. Make some baby
  bok choy and soba noodles to go along with them (and to soak up more of the broth
  – no sake goes to waste in our house).
