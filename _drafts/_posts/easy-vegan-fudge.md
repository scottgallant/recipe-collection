yield: Makes one 6x6 baking dish
authorNote: The texture is almost truffle-like, and closer to dark chocolate than
  to milk chocolate. Even though the yield in this recipe is small, plan to give some
  away to friends and family. It’s super addictive and you’ll be popping those fudge
  squares in your mouth before you realize you’ve eating half the batch.
personalNote: If you're making this for someone who's actually vegan (as opposed to
  why we do, just because they taste delicious), make sure you're using vegan chocolate.
  It's harder to find than you might think, but we find it at Central Market.
