yield: Depends on how much salmon you make at a time, anywhere between ½ lb to 2 lb.
authorNote: This is not the lox I grew up with, but this salty, lemony cured salmon
  is subtler and doesn't require much more than a few days of patience and fridge
  space.
personalNote: |-
  For an even lemony-er version, zest 1 ½ lemons and use ¼ rind of a preserved lemon.

  > Serve with blueberry curd, latkes, and creme fraiche for a Hannukah spin, or Nordic style, with rye crostini, pickled fennel bulb, mustard seeds and creme fraiche (pictured).
