authorNote: The texture is almost truffle-like, and closer to dark chocolate than
  to milk chocolate. Even though the yield in this recipe is small, plan to give some
  away to friends and family. It’s super addictive and you’ll be popping those fudge
  squares in your mouth before you realize you’ve eating half the batch.
