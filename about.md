# Hello. 

And welcome to my personal recipe collection.

## This is a grand experiment.

Somehow, there's no out-of-the-box solution out there on the internet that works the way I want it to (said every <a href="http://www.sharonbrener.com">designer</a> ever), so I'm biting the bullet and making it myself. In the process, I'm slowly teaching myself Jekyll, Git, and deep diving into CSS/HTML for the first time since college. Seems like the world's a little different out there. 

## This site is pretty simple.

Some recipes will be <a href="/tag/family">our family recipes</a> or <a href="/tag/basic">simple basics</a>, others will be <a href="/tag/diy-project">bigger DIY projects</a> like making your own bitters or kombucha. Most of these are direct translations from other sources (thank you, sources) and I lay no claims to the content.

Eventually, I hope to add fancy search and commenting functionality so that I can document what I've learned every time I make <a href="/tag/to-do">something new</a>. This is also an exercise in teaching myself to be patient. Is it working yet?

## So, if you've magically stumbled on this site, <a href="http://sharonbrener.com/contact/">say hi</a>. I hope it makes you hungry.
